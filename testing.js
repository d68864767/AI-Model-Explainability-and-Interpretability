// testing.js

// This script file is associated with the AI Model Testing and Validation page.

// Here, we can add any JavaScript functionality needed for the Testing and Validation page.

// For example, we might want to add some interactivity to the sections on the page, 
// or we might want to fetch and display some data related to AI model testing and validation.

// As per the project description, some potential features could include:

// - Displaying different test case generation techniques when a button is clicked
// - Fetching data about validation in different deployment environments from an API and displaying it on the page
// - Displaying a diagram or chart that illustrates continuous testing strategies in CI/CD pipelines

// However, without more specific requirements or details about the desired functionality, 
// we can't write the actual code for these features at this time.

// So, for now, this file will remain mostly empty, just like the main script.js file.

// Any future JavaScript functionality needed for the Testing and Validation page should be added here.
