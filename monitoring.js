// monitoring.js

// This script file is currently empty as per the project description and the provided code snippets.
// Any future JavaScript functionality needed for the project can be added here.

// For example, you might want to add some interactivity to the sections in the monitoring.html file.
// You could use JavaScript to show/hide content, create custom alerts, or integrate with an incident management system.

// Here is a simple example of how you might use JavaScript to add some interactivity to the "Real-time versus batch monitoring strategies" section:

document.getElementById('real-time-vs-batch').addEventListener('click', function() {
    var content = this.querySelector('p');
    if (content.style.display === 'none') {
        content.style.display = 'block';
    } else {
        content.style.display = 'none';
    }
});

// You can add similar event listeners to the other sections as needed.
