// debugging.js

// This script file is associated with the AI Model Debugging and Profiling page.

// Here, you can add any JavaScript functionality needed for the debugging page.

// For example, you might want to add interactivity to the guides, performance benchmarks, and cloud integration sections.

// You could use the document.getElementById method to select these sections and then add event listeners to them.

// Here's a basic example for the guides section:

document.getElementById('guides').addEventListener('click', function() {
    // This code will run when the guides section is clicked.
    console.log('The guides section was clicked.');
});

// You can do something similar for the performance benchmarks and cloud integration sections.

document.getElementById('performance-benchmarks').addEventListener('click', function() {
    // This code will run when the performance benchmarks section is clicked.
    console.log('The performance benchmarks section was clicked.');
});

document.getElementById('cloud-integration').addEventListener('click', function() {
    // This code will run when the cloud integration section is clicked.
    console.log('The cloud integration section was clicked.');
});

// Remember, this is just a basic example. You'll likely want to replace the console.log statements with more useful functionality.
