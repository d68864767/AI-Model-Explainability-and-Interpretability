// fairness.js

// This script file is currently empty as per the project description and the provided code snippets.
// Any future JavaScript functionality needed for the AI Model Fairness and Bias Mitigation page can be added here.

// For example, you might want to add interactivity to the sections, fetch data from an API, or handle form submissions.

// Here is a simple example of how you might add some interactivity:

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const sections = document.querySelectorAll('main section');

    sections.forEach(section => {
        section.addEventListener('click', function() {
            this.classList.toggle('expanded');
        });
    });
});

// This code waits until the DOM is fully loaded, then adds a click event listener to each section.
// When a section is clicked, it toggles the 'expanded' class.
// You could use this to expand/collapse sections, show/hide additional information, etc.
// Remember to define the 'expanded' class in your CSS.
